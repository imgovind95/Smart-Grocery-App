                    Founded in 2025, SmartCart has come a long way from its beginnings. When we first started out, our passion for providing fresh and affordable groceries drove us to build a platform that can serve customers right at their doorstep. We now serve customers all over the city and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into our own website.

                    We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.
